# `Flashcard Generator`

This is a frontend capstone project assignment from almabetter, it is a flashcard generator app which helps in creating multiple 
flashcards  in a group, this app lets us `create`, `add images along with text` , `share`, `download`, `delete` and `also print the created flashcard`,
The user interface of this app is completely responsive.

## `Description`

This project was created individually by me, it was build using different frontend technologies namely `React` javascript library,`Tailwind CSS `
for designing the responsive UI, `Redux` for state management, `React-icons`, `Formik`, `React-Router-Dom`, `react-testing-library` for testing and  `verecel` for 
deploying. 
Languages used in this project are `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`. 

This Project Consists of  3 Main Pages.
 1. ### `Create New Page` (Home Page)
 
 here we create new group of cards by filling all the required details and clicking on create.
 
 2. ### `My FlashCard Page` 
 
 here we can see all the created cards groups which has a Heading of the group ,the groupicon image , description of 
 cardgroup, total number of cards in the group and a button for viewing the cards on next page.  
 
 3. ### `FlashCard Details Page`
 
 here we can see the created cards, we can navigate to different flashcards by clicking on sidebar terms 
 given to the card while creating group, we can also share, print and download the flashcard.
